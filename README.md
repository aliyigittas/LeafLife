### LeafLife
Farmers usually check the leaves of their crops to identify diseases early and prevent them from spreading. 

However, disease identification can be a challenge for farmers sometimes.

To address this challenge, we have developed a mobile application called LeafLife. 

By using LeafLife, we aim to contribute to two of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals which are Responsible Consumption and Production, and Life on Land.

We have three main pages on our application. The Home page is designed to display all of a farmer's previous scan results in one place, as we believe this is important information for them to have. The Explore page provides information on all the diseases that our application can detect, including possible solutions to those diseases. The Profile page displays the user's profile information.
To scan a new plant, users can click on the button located in the bottom right corner of every page. This scan page allows them to choose between selecting an image from their phone's gallery or taking a photo to use for the scan. 
The scan results are automatically added to the Home page once the scan is completed.
